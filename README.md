this function is why to long, its suppose to be split to 2 functions.

function saveTask() {   

suppose to be isCompleted not completed
if (task.completed) {


Again, this funciton is why to long.
createTaskNoteElement(task) {

why selector inside a function?

const note = document.createElement('div');


beside that - great work!
